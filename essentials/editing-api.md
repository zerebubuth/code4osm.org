All new data and modifications to OpenStreetMap go through the editing
API, which is generally accessed from one of various
[editing tools](editing-tools.html) written and maintained by the
OpenStreetMap community. Therefore, understanding the API and the data
model it is built on, is very important when building tools which
interact with OpenStreetMap data.

# The data model

The [data model](data-model.html) is an abstract view of how data is
stored in OpenStreetMap. 

For specifics on how data is stored, see the sections on the
[database](database.html), [data dumps](data-dumps.html) and
[data diffs](data-diffs.html).
