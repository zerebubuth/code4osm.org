The OpenStreetMap website is a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)
application which has very many (some might say too many) roles within
the project - from displaying the map and search interface, through to
serving [API](editing-api.html) requests.

# Functions of the website

A few of the more important functions that the website provides to the
OpenStreetMap community are:

* User management: contributors sign up and can manage their accounts
  through the website.
* Contribute to the map: most of the [editing API](editing-api.html)
  is implemented as part of the website. This is how a contributor's
  edits are uploaded from their [editing tool](editing-tools.html).
* Map viewing and sharing: the front page prominently displays a large
  map, which can be shared by links or embedded HTML fragments. It is
  also possible to export small areas of the map as images.
* Search: the front page has search functionality to allow a visitor
  to find an area of interest, look up an address or point of
  interest.
* Data browsing: the website exports the history of the map as a set
  of linked pages which can be used to quickly and manually look up or
  check information.
* GPS traces: contributors can upload GPS traces, which are then made
  available (with selectable degrees of privacy) for use in
  [editing tools](editing-tools.html) to improve the map.
* User diaries: each signed-up contributor is able to write 'diary'
  entries - a sort of minimalistic blog - which other contributors can
  comment on or see in an RSS feed.
* User messaging: users can send each other messages - a sort of
  minimalistic email - without revealing their email addresses.
