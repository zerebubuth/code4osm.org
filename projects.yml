    Learn about the essentials of how geographic data are structured in OSM,
    how to interact with the OSM APIs, how data flow through the OSM
    infrastructure and ecosystem. If you want to get an idea of how OSM is
    structured at a very large scale, then this is a great place to start.

    Although the OSM website and API are written in Ruby on Rails, it can
    be inefficient to run all API calls through it. This software could
    be looked at as an &quot;accelerator&quot; for the Rails code, giving
    lower memory usage, more control over database queries and sometimes
    a faster response.

    OSM data is dumped on a regular basis to provide input for many bits
    of software and services which process, analyse and present geographic
    data or information derived from OSM. This all starts with a huge file
    which is produced by this bit of software.
